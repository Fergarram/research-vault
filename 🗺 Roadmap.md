## Long-term vision (5-10 years)

* Alpha versions of world simulation tools
* Alpha versions of cognitive architecture tools
* CogArch, Mind Studio

## Mid-term vision (2-5 years)

* Video game based on my engines
* Solid primitives for my engines
* Gain true fans / Auto-sustainable project

## Short-term vision (1-2 years)

* Start recording progress and create devlogs or offline-streams
* Simple world simulations (brain dump doc)
* Connect world to brains (server to CogArch emulator) and perform experiments
* Create experiments per word in “words for analyzing”
* Focus on use cases and the words that emerge from those fake conversations. It’s those words that will gain priority when creating experiments to test those concepts.

## How can I make a living?

I like the **true fans** option better. I see that as a more tangible one that gets a better result in the end. It’s also a patience play.

The only problem is time, but that’s actually not a big big problem.

### How can I add value to others?

Selling pre-trained brains for video games seems like the best first use-case for actually making money.
* based on genre
* language
* etc

Selling pre-trained brains for tools is the longer-term option.
* Amos / WonderOS

I don’t really want to build software tools in order to make money (IDEs, text editors, etc). I would love to already have them within the environment I like.

I would like to work on them, but not for money. Maybe just customize them (?)  What I mean is I don’t want to code those tools in a traditional sense — it would have to be with the new itemized paradigm.

Having said this, I think I would prefer to make money by selling the trained brains. This is a long-long term goal. I would first need to make a living just by supporters and not by selling a product or service.

### Amos is secondary

I really want to commit to the development of digital cognition tools. My OS research and tool development is secondary, but it will eventually merge with my digital cognition tools.
