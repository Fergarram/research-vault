This document serves as a place to add all brain dump notes. It's a sort of purgatory of ideas.

I guess that the difference between real cortical columns and my ego cells/grid cells is the fact that my cells have the purpose of mirroring the attributes of their world that I care about.

In my view a brain is divided in three parts:

1. A model maker (cortical columns)
	- Permanence through time indicate agents or isolated elements
	- The cells need to be able to compare observed raw data through time.
		- Interaction with the world helps to gain more input that reinforces such.

2. An attention system (emotions, etc)
	- What motives the cells to do what they need to do?
	- What behavior do we want to elicit?

3. A hardware control system (body regulations, etc)
	- How does the system maintain itself alive and capable?
	- In the world, time kills you, there is not infinite energy.

Which attributes about the world are important for us?
- Depends on the use case, is it for a video game, an assistant?

I think that making it for a video game might be a very good first step.

I need to update my documentation about cognitive mechanisms but it would make more sense to update them after doing more experiments.
