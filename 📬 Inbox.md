This document is like a TODO list and small brain-dump space. For a major vision, visit the [[ðŸ—º Roadmap]] document.

## Current Priorities

* Keep working on [[ðŸ”¬ Experiment 001a - Parsing Markdown with Cellular Automata]].
* Read the new book I bought
* Have monthly/etc calls with Nick to review my work or some other similar social tool like this

## Regarding Obscure and UX

* Create a user journey of your work so people can navigate it
* Improve Obscure so that it covers most features

Brain dumps go here. If nothing is below this text it means whatever was written here got trashed or evolved into a document.
