This document serves as a place to add all brain dump notes. It's a sort of purgatory of ideas.

I need to put the following somewhere:

In my opinion, OSes like WonderOS will probably be only realistically possible if it's implemented as high-quality pro tools for the following platforms:

For Windows: As a software that runs on top of it.

For Linux: As a distro.

For Mac: As a software that runs on top of it.

For both Windows and Mac, the benefit will be the software tools (which is what would be sold).

On Linux, since it's a whole distro, we can address it in multiple ways.

1. An almost-native way of handling existing pieces of software.
2. An ecosystem of software tools (for both devs and pro users). 

This almost-native way of handling linux computing primitives (processes, etc) through a Desktop Environment that's user customizable with actual good UX, is the key to the success of an OS such as WonderOS.

It would be interesting to explore those base computing units.

I guess that the difference between real cortical columns and my ego cells/grid cells is the fact that my cells have the purpose of mirroring the attributes of their world that I care about.

In my view a brain is divided in three parts:

1. A model maker (cortical columns)
	- Permanence through time indicate agents or isolated elements
	- The cells need to be able to compare observed raw data through time.
		- Interaction with the world helps to gain more input that reinforces such.

2. An attention system (emotions, etc)
	- What motives the cells to do what they need to do?
	- What behavior do we want to elicit?

3. A hardware control system (body regulations, etc)
	- How does the system maintain itself alive and capable?
	- In the world, time kills you, there is not infinite energy.

Which attributes about the world are important for us?
- Depends on the use case, is it for a video game, an assistant?

I think that making it for a video game might be a very good first step.

I need to update my documentation about cognitive mechanisms but it would make more sense to update them after doing more experiments.
