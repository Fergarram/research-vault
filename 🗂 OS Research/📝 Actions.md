## Thoughts

Every piece of software should have actions and it should be easy by default for developers to think and work this way. This is the only way we can create a system that's invocable by anyone at any time in any context.

Alex is already thinking about this of course. Many people actually. What I'm trying to bring here is the idea that AMIs will also use actions.

Oh boy, there are a lot of beautiful things coming soon. I can feel it.
