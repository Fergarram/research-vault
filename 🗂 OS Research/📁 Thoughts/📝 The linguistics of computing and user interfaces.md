Everything below is currently just a brain dump of ideas I don't know where else to put.

I've been imagining how a cellular automata-based UI framework would work. This is considering that neighboring rules and the grid they play in are just one way of existing â€” the grid could be a hierarchichal or tree-shaped space that contains UI at a particular event-state, and the neighboring rules the proximity or relationship based on their available actions.

I was thinking that maybe this would help with animations and other transition effects.

Keyboard Commands as language articles, prepositions and other shit I don't understand about linguistics

I want to ask ChatGPT to help me with this idea.

CMD + Space = OS Command Bar
CMD + P = Print / Open File
CMD + SHIFT + P = App Command Bar
CMD + T = New Tab / Arc Command Bar

...

This gets the idea started.
