## Introduction

Calling this section of the wiki "OS Research" sounds a bit too much. 

Ever since I was about 10 years old, I dreamed and played with making my own computers and operating systems. I would take cardboard boxes and convert them to computers with OSX-looking desktops. I would make mobile phones that resemble the [phones of the time](https://www.mobilephonemuseum.com/catalogue) by using little wooden pieces, tape, nails, markers and even rubber bands. I wish I still had them but they got lost in the countless times I moved houses.

Since then, I have been OBSESSED about computers and the internet. So when I say "OS Research" it's really just a collection of my observations, prototypes and radical ideas that I've accumulated for the past two decades.

## Obsessions

I'm currently thinking and experimenting with spatial software designs. This means that I'm essentially putting [[üìù Everything on a canvas]].
