## Final thoughts

In my opinion, OSes like WonderOS will probably be only realistically possible if it's implemented as high-quality pro tools for the following platforms:

For Windows: As a software that runs on top of it.

For Linux: As a distro.

For Mac: As a software that runs on top of it.

For both Windows and Mac, the benefit will be the software tools (which is what would be sold).

On Linux, since it's a whole distro, we can address it in multiple ways.

1. An almost-native way of handling existing pieces of software.
2. An ecosystem of software tools (for both devs and pro users). 

This almost-native way of handling linux computing primitives (processes, etc) through a Desktop Environment that's user customizable with actual good UX, is the key to the success of an OS such as WonderOS.

It would be interesting to explore those base computing units.

I want my OS Research to be aimed towards defining and prototyping the base primitives of actual OSes (the software that manages computer resources, hardware, etc) and see how we can use existing technology such as Linux to bring a similar revolution as that of Alex Obenauer.
