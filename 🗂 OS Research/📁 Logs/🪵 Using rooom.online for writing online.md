I want to start prototyping with the experience of having rooom.online and just being able to create rooms private and public. Given I've been prototyping with the cursor experience in [[ðŸªµ Cursor-centric UI for web room thing interactions â€” A first draft]], it's pretty obvious that I need to try the whole publishing flow.

Besides finishing the cursor and tools modules, another thing I need to finish on the frontend for "v1" is zooming. Native zooming is more performant but it sucks. This is ok for me but we can wait.

Everything else is just polishing and adding more modules.

I'm particularly interested in seeing what the module management experience is when using rooom.online... creating, editing, branching, etc.
