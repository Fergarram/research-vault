As of Feb 29, 2024, this project was a lab for a lot of experimentation for everything canvas related. I even explored topics like [[📝 CRDTs]] and [[📝 Data Persistence]] in general.

But after working on the [[🔬 HTML as the static canvas format]] experiment, I feel the need to change and maybe even commit to a final intent for this project or product:

"suna.garden" is a tool for creating web rooms or canvas web docs.

Specifically, it allows users to:
- Use are.na blocks as content cards
- Customize the room's wallpaper, metadata, etc.
- Export html files to do whatev the fuck you want.
- Upload directly to are.na channels as html file.

I want to make `suna.garden/logs` a blog/feed page that shows my activity:
- Relevant updates on obscurity.wiki
- Blocks added on relevant are.na channels
- Communication about its progress and development such as announcements or just thoughts.
