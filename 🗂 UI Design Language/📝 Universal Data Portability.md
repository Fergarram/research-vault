Cass is basically a query language lol

You gotta know what fields are there and need a way to explore them basically.

Exploration sometimes does not require Cass but instead a manual control.

Conversation with Cass:
```
Get me all the articles ordered by date. Only show me the their tags, title, summary and cover image.

Show me those that I wrote before 2020.

Before 2020 ended.
```

As a third-party data owner, how should I create an API wrapper that’s understandable by (Cass) the OS? This assumes there’s a way for manual exploration and an awareness of what the fields represent in the databases.
