# Introduction to Dynamics

Examples:
- Planetary Dynamics
- Fluid Dynamics
- Turbulence Dynamics
- Electrical Dynamics
- Climate Dynamics
- Crowd Dynamics
- Population Dynamics
- Financial Dynamics
- Group Dynamics
- Social Dynamics (conflict and cooperation)


It's a general field.
There are quatitative tools such as differential equations.


Dynamical Systems Theory:
> The branch of math for how systems change over time.
> It gives us vocabulary and tools for describing dynamics
> It's the attempt to describe general principles regarding systems that change over time using deterministic equations.
> Universaility in Chaos - Characteristics that are universal across a wide set of chaotic systems. It's these characteristics that may be predictable.


Sub branches:
- Calculus
- Diff equations
- Iterated maps
- Algebraic topology
- etc


Notes:
- So basically, Isaac Newton wanted to understand the dynamics of objects and their movement, which in order to proof his ideas he developed calculus. Or at least that's what I understand so far.
- What is the difference between chaos and randomness?
- What's "deterministic chaos"?
- A model is a simple representation of something in nature

Ideas:
- Related to [[üë®üèª‚Äçüíª On Publishing]]: Are there predictions that we humans can make that would be impossible or very difficult/power intense for math or algorithms? Does current AI fill this gap? This basically assumes that there is a way to compress the behavior of complex systems into a single model which could fit the observed behavior. But this would not mean that what's observed can fit in a model. What's observed could in fact be infinite or eternal and never able to be captured into a single compressed view.

Logistic Map
- `X_t+1 = R ‚Ä¢¬†(X_t - X_t^2)`
- Still unsure about how it is used and why it works
- Ultimate dynamics
- Fixed point attractor (dynamics)
- What's the proof that says that it will always reach a stable fixed point? It doesn't it seems, it can infinetily oscilate between diff states, called periodic attractor.
- Oscilations can vary on multiple states
- If growth rate (`R`) increases it becomes harder to predict what the state will be later on. This is called "Chaos".
- Prediction becomes impossible with different initial values of `X_t`
- Bifurcation Diagram ![[Bifurcation Diagram.png]]
- "Onset of chaos" (3.569946...) is the value of growth rate (`R`) that produces an infinite set of states in which the population oscillates.
- Feigenbaum's universal constant ~= 4.6692016... which stands for the acceleration in which chaos grows

- Fixed point attractor regime
- Periodic attractor regime
- Chaotic or "Strange" attractor regime


There are "Unibody maps" or "one-humped maps" like the Logistic Map. They all share some universalities like Feigenbaum's universal constant and the eventual rise to chaos.
