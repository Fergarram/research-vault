# What is complexity?

Complex Systems Research
- Core disciplines
	- Dynamics: The study of continually changing structure and behavior of systems.
	- Information: The study of representation, symbols, and communication.
	- Computation: The study of how systems process information and act on the results.
	- Evolution: The study of how systems adapt to environments that change over time.
- Goals
	- Through the use of mathematics and computation, we create cross-disciplinary insights into complex systems.
	- Development of a general theory of complexity (what I was trying to say about the impact ego cells could have on science and research)
- Methodologies
	- Experimental work
	- Theoretical work
	- Computer simulations

Examples of complex systems:
- Ants
- Termites
- Neurons
- Immune System
- Genomes
	- Genetic Regulatory Network
		- Compression algorithm for development of the body
- Food Web
- Social Networks
- Economies
	- Financial Institutions Networks
- Cities

Props:
- Simple individually, complex in masses
- Decentraliced organization
- Agents adapt themselves to situations
- Agents communicate in simple ways
- High connectivity results in stable responses to change
- Components interact in non-linear ways
	- The sum is more the all parts together
- Emergent Behaviors ‚Äî The experience
	- Hierarchical organizations (holons)
	- Information Processing (as a whole only)
	- Complex Dynamics (changes in space and time) (unpredictability, entropy)
	- Evolution and learning (adaptation)

Ideas:
- Space representations ([[üß© Spatial or Network or Social Awareness]]) seem to be analogous to network representations. I used to think that visual patterns lead to the idea of space and layout but I think it's the other way around. Network representaions lead to patterns that can be represented visually.
- One can't represent complex systems with static representations (like equations) because it would mean that one would need an equation per part per moment that flows through time. Maybe lol.
