Here's a definition of intelligence by William James:

> "Intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means"

I would extend this and say:
    
> "Intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means and computational limitations."
    
I'm pretty sure there is more into this definition.

Michael Levin words:
- Get to the same outcome
	- despite perturbations (external and internal)
	- via different paths (in morphospace, for example)
	- from diverse starting positions
- Error minimization machines

Multi-scale intelligence, or multi-space intelligence fully depends on the concept of small programs.
    
Geometric shapes are data structures for complexity in space

Idea:
A good problem to solve is figuring out how to set goals in specific spaces. Like in morphospace, the goal is to build a specific geometry of a physiological body. It's an invariant goal, similar to my old idea of a pure truth of markdown.

What evolution does is behaviour shaping, it's figuring out signals to get agential material to do whatever you want.
