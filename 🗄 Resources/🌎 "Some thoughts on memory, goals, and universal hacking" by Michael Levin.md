# Some thoughts on memory, goals, and universal hacking

This was a wonderful read. It helped me understand the light cone model better. Now I understand the dimensions it encompasses. 

What I still don't understand very much is the difference between 3d navigational space of the individual and the morphological space. I understand what does mean separately but it's not very clear how they relate between each other in relation to this light cone model.

Here are the most important things to note for myself:
- Persistence of memories/knowledge
- Architecture independent knowledge model
- The idea that to have memories or "static data" like a windows executable binary for a game to persist, there have to be living entities that are able to interpret it and create copies of it for other living entities to do the same — Web crawlers could be a proto-entity for this concept. The web is a rich space in resources and unexpected interactions. [[📝 World Building]][[💡 Artificial Worlds]]

Following on the idea of persistence of information I'll use a different document. [[📝 Data Persistence]]
