People sometimes ask for a kind of introductory starter pack of information to get into the things that my lab and I work on. Here are some ways to begin to get acquainted with the research. Black is reading material, green are videos.

## First, more generally-accessible material:

- [Levin, M., and Dennett, D. C. (2020), How to understand cells, tissues and organisms as agents with agendas, Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co)
- [Levin, M., and Yuste, R. (2022), Modular cognition, Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co)
- [Finkelstein J., McLaughlin K., and Levin M. (2019), Interdisciplinary Approach Needed to Crack Morphogenesis, The Scientist, December 2019](https://www.the-scientist.com)

## More in-depth:

After that introductory material, you can see the entire thing [here](https://drmichaellevin.org) (dive in and don’t forget the links on the left side of each page, they lead to additional content).

- [Overview of the research; all peer-reviewed work: chronologically, but here it is by topic](https://drmichaellevin.org) – start with whatever area interests you.
- [Talks I’ve given, and discussions with others and interviews, including a bunch of working meetings with really great people](https://www.youtube.com)

Then, check out some of my close collaborators:
