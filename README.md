## Where to start

This website is my personal research garden/wiki. I focus on two major research and experimentation areas: [[📝 Cognitive Research]] and [[📝 OS Research]].

As with any [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), documents can be at different "growth" stages independently of their type (as explained below). For example, you might find that there are empty pages. This allows me to "plant" ideas which I slowly "hydrate" and fill with information and connections. It also allows me to validate and fomalize concepts.

### Document taxonomy

I try to organize everything in a meaningful or useful way. You can think of this website as a text editor that displays and allows you to read a codebase (i.e. Sublime Text or VS Code). I use emojis as icons to identify the type of document. For example, the 📝 icon is used to identify synthesized topics or concepts within a research space. The 🔬 icon is used to identify experiment documents, and for my experiment notes I use the 📎 icon to store important ideas related to a specific experiment.

## 🗂 Cognitive Research

The main purpose of my research in this space is to figure out what's needed to implement a set of tools that would allow us to design and prototype different types of artificial general intelligence (AGI). I argue that AGI doesn't need to be human-like in every way, but rather, just with the parts we need it to.

You can find a more detailed guide in the introductory page at [[📝 Cognitive Research]]. There I explain more about my approach and how to navigate my work.

## 🗂 OS Research

Computer operating systems are taken for granted now a days. Computers are more ubiquous than ever. One would think that this would result in a better user experience and a general improvement in this space, but it's actually quite the contrary: Rushed feature development, agile stategies, a leaking backlog full of bugs and an uncaring relationship with users well being are making our computers harder to use for professional work and hurting our fragile human minds with dopamine spikes and user interfaces designed to be addictive.

Having said this, my research focuses on distilling our current knowledge about how we use computers and how we develop software into primitives and core ideas. A better example of this work is what [Alex Obenauer](https://alexanderobenauer.com/) is doing with his lab notes and [WonderOS](https://wonderos.org/). Since he's quite ahead in this field with his idea of an itemized OS, I want to focus more on the "lower-level" primitives like processes, files, memory, etc. My main goal is to be able to teach an artificial mind how to understand these primitives and interact with them, and to build a base for thinking about computer resources with an itemized approach as well. You can find more about this research space at [[📝 OS Research]].


## 🗄 Resources

[[📝 Resources]] is a list and guide to manage external resources like papers, books, articles, etc. If I find it's useful, I usually create notes about them.
