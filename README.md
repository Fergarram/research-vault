## On getting this done

I feel like I need to not get lost on organizing data. Which is easy to do right now because I just found out about the linking and query tools in Obsidian.

I need to keep the goal obvious: To make an artificial mind capable of speaking english.


## Organization

I got inspired by this: [[🎥 "Comprehensive Obsidian Zettelkasten Workflow"]]



## On managing resources

[[👨🏻‍💻 Resources]]



## Collaboration

How does a collaborative graph tool looks like?

I was thinking of using git to manage contributions and version history but I'm thinking that an app could also work.

The advantage of an app would be the UI. Being able to create visual nodes and connecting data and ideas like that. I think that Obsidian already does that so there could even be an MVP using Git and Obsidian without the UI part or the backend for that UI.
