# My Public Research Vault

This is a repository containing the Obsidian vault for all my research. I apologize for the lack of a better introduction here.

[[📬 TODO]] Is the place where I keep my list of tasks related to this vault.

There are 3 major folders or topics:

- [[📝 Cognitive Research]]
- [[📝 Complexity Research]]
- [[📝 OS Research]]

[[👨🏻‍💻 Resources]] is a list and guide to manage external resources like papers, books, articles, etc. For each parsed resource I add personal notes about it.


## Collaboration

Pull requests are welcomed. As the time of writing this, I don't expect people to be participating yet. But I think that as people (hopefully) get interested in participating rules will start to come out as to how to collaborate.
