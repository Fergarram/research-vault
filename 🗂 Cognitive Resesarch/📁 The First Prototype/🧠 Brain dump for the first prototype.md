I need to set a finite and tangible first prototype of a world, mind and implementation. Because I speculate on the optimal idea where there's this virtual assistant that is my digital artificial friend and stuff but I need an initial prototype.

## Ideas

### Make it literally be an MMORPG.

This would get me to define a world, rules, objectives, and would get players to help train the mind. Actually, it would be even better if every player would train their minds as their babies!

The game doesn't have to be medieval lol. It can be like The Sims if needed.

It makes it fun to work on, tangible and relatable. It also makes it fun to watch in terms of the development process.

It makes for a great show and social experiment kinda thing.

It's a safe test environment. Why? because those artificial minds are not plugable into the real world. They would be limited to that fake world only.

It would make sense to make the humans some kind of "witcher" type beings that aren't quite as the AMIs in there.


### Midnight idea about feelings

I need to perform some tests. To give MMORPG players some cameras that feed an AI algorith that tries to understand the emotion at play. The algoritm might not be perfect but we need to have a way for the AMIs to mimic and understand the feeling around interactions between players.


### Every player would have their own "child" AMI

Running the neurons in the client instead of the server ~~might be a good optimization~~ is a must.


### Recordings

It will most likely be the case that we'll need to throw away an implementation or refactor something fundamental that would require to reset or "kill" an artificial mind. In order to save time, we could record all the events and texts in a way that allows us to replay manually inputed events so that the new version of a mind will go through the same process again, automatically.

## Implementation

When I think of the first prototype for an artificial mind, I imagine a text grid much like playing an ASCII rougue-like game in a shell. At first I felt that this was just a weird idea I was having, but the more I work on this and the more I think about it, the more it actually makes sense.

If the world it lives is made out of characters in a grid, there wouldn't be a need for more complex ideas with higher resolutions or three-dimentional spaces.

Most of the things we programmers do on computers can actually be done in a terminal â€” Unix systems are the best example.

It also makes sense when I think about the obscurity and ocultism-like feature of living in TTYs, playing Tibia, using Vi, etc. On those examples, you have to learn their language, you have to learn the spells, commands and shortcuts. And everything goes around grid-based systems of characters (except Tibia but it could be translated, maybe Dwarf Fortress is a better example).

This does not mean that we should go back to text-based systems. It's mainly just AMIs that would live here and be some kind of obscure wizards. We would be more as Gods that communicate through a nice prompt or chat box. The AMIs' spells would conjure interfaces, commands and algorithms.

Even characters themselves could be zoomed-in and seen as grids of pixels  represented with "characters".

### Main ideas?
* Grid-based
* Multi-screen
* Zoom levels
* Sequential Nature
* Color Space Representation
	* Contrast representation, etc.
