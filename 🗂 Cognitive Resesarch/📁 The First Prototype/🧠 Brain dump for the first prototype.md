I need to set a finite and tangible first prototype of a world, mind and implementation. Because I speculate on the optimal idea where there's this virtual assistant that is my digital artificial friend and stuff but I need an initial prototype.

## Ideas

### Make it literally be an MMORPG.

This would get me to define a world, rules, objectives, and would get players to help train the mind. Actually, it would be even better if every player would train their minds as their babies!

The game doesn't have to be medieval lol. It can be like seems if needed.

It makes it fun to work on, tangible and relatable. It also makes it fun to watch in terms of the development process.

It makes for a great show and social experiment kinda thing.

It's a safe test environment. Why? because those artificial minds are not plugable into the real world. They would be limited to that fake world only.


### Midnight idea about feelings

I need to perform some tests. To give MMORPG players some cameras that feed an AI algorith that tries to understand the emotion at play. The algoritm might not be perfect but we need to have a way for the AMIs to mimic and understand the feeling around interactions between players.

### Every player would have their own "child" AMI

Running the neurons in the client instead of the server might be a good optimization.
