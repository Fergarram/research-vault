## Notes from meditation session

I was in a meditation session and visualized attention as an entity whose constantly called by different things, for example, thoughts and sensations. I also saw how there is focus which is what happens when something (someone) in the space of awareness gets “attention” to pay attention.

I imagined little raised hands, little people each representing a thought, idea, sensation, sound, etc.

What is it that controls attention?

## Possible implementation - Screens idea

This relates to [[📝 Artificial Bodies]], [[🧩 Spatial or Network or Social Awareness]] as it might point to the [[📝 Technical Implementation]].

When thinking about the emulation of attention, I thought of the idea of an AMI having multiple “screens” where different information appears.

For example, a screen for showing “others”, a screen for showing text in a conversation, a screen for objects near the "hands", etc.

This makes it easier in comparison with trying to emulate a two-dimensional world with a model of our 3D view.
