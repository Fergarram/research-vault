#list [[📝 Cognitive Architecture]]

This is a list of "cognitive mechanisms" for a lack of a better term. The purpose behind this document is to have an index of mechanisms, mechanisms which are needed for an AMI to produce the behavior we need.

Ideally, I want to be developing each of these mechanisms into full ideas that can be implemented later on.

These ideas can be merged, deleted, etc. or more can be added.
