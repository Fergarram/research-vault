Space representations seem to be analogous to network representations. I used to think that visual patterns lead to the idea of space and layout but I think it's the other way around. Network representaions lead to patterns that can be represented visually.


## Spatial

I think for the spatial we have a sense of proximity to features or nodes in a grid. I don't think we replicate all the movements that got us to a place but rather that we know how to move through space and we identify cues or signs about the place where we are at.
