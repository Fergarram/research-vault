Possibly named Mind Studio, the main idea here is that the main goal of my research is to create a tool. A tool that allows people who often wonder and think how their minds and others' work to experiment, play and build intelligent agents or artificial minds.

This means that my [[📝 Experiments]] will often be aimed towards figuring out how to implement such tool.
