## Introduction

Figuring out how to train artificial minds without traditional training data is a big challenge. But I think this is where the gold is. My main idea here is that given a digital world where our experiences overlap, our role as creators of that world is also to teach the artificial mind about that world. This would be through the process of being Jesus Christ.

we implicitely learn to learn as humans.

What I mean by that is that our purpose as humans throughout our infancy, is to learn to learn.

This is induced in various cultural techniques that we have been taught from our parents and their parents' parents.

Our current school systems and culture/beliefs about it is such a technique.
