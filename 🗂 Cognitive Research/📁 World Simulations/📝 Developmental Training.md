## Introduction

Figuring out how to train artificial minds without traditional training data is a big challenge. But I think this is where the gold is. My main idea here is that given a digital world where our experiences overlap, our role as creators of that world is also to teach the artificial mind about that world. This would be through the process of being Jesus Christ.

We implicitely learn to learn as kids.

What I mean by that is that our purpose as humans throughout our infancy, is to learn to learn.

This is induced by various cultural techniques that we have been taught from our parents and their parents' parents.

Our current school systems and culture/beliefs about it is such a construct.

Not only is it important to figure out the tools to bring a digital being to existance, but the knowledge about this exact craft.

One needs to understand these basic constructs to a fundamental level - learned as the model of how to learn to "learn".
