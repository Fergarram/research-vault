While I was working on this experiment I was also reading papers such as [[ðŸ“‘ "A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex" by Numenta]]. This paper proposes a framework for model-making that's based on the spatial properties and representations of objects in time. This research is based on humans and other animals which exist in and perceive this three-dimensional and physical world. I'm bringing this up because I couldn't help myself but come to hypothesize that for a 2D world made up of symbols in a grid, there has to be a similar approach that requires some analogous form of 2D grid cells, which takes me back to the previous paragraph where I mentioned a kind of coordinate system.

My new theory is that there has to be a similar framework for strictly two-dimensional grid-based spaces which requires the existance of multiple cell types or cell interactions. A universe's number of spatial dimensions and laws would determine how such a framework would be used.

In this experiment's case, there are a few ideas I have in regards to defining a spatial framework for representing information about systems within this bi-dimensional world of markdown.
