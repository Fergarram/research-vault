Something else that I'm noticing is that each experiment contains a ton of ideas that are hard to organize in a single text file. This is where a tool like Muse would come in. If not, then a different approach to be able to play with this ideas while being able to revisit them later.

I think a good approach for now is to approach it in a component-based way like when writing UI code.

For this reason, I'm creating a folder with unorganized notes for each experiment.
