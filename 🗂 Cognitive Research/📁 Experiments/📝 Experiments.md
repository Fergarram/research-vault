## Introduction

This document is a starting point for navigating and understanding the way I document my experiments and how I share the results. Having said this, my experiments are mainly aimed towards finding out how to implement a substrate for the [[📝 Cognitive Mechanisms]] to be implemented on.

## Explorations

At this point in time, I haven't created that many experiments but I envision them covering cellular automata, parallel computing strategies, server-client architectures, etc.

## On organizing experiment notes

Each experiment contains a ton of ideas that are hard to organize in a single text file. I need to be able to play with these ideas while being able to revisit them later.

I think a good approach for now is to approach it in a component-based way like when writing UI code.

For this reason, I'm creating a folder with unorganized notes for each experiment. I'm calling these type of notes "Clip Notes" and use the 📎 icon to identify their type.

I also created a document type that represents tests for a given experiment. There are identified with the 🧪 icon. Each of these documents represents a tag in the experiment repository so that I can keep track of each test's results. Since these are mostly code-based experiments, test basically represent approaches or versions of each experiment until I reach a point of success or failure.

## Experiment Ideas

> Think of the words needed to communicate with a [personal assistant, npc in a video game, etc] by manually simulating a real conversation. For example, if a video game, visualize the conversations and what you're doing and then pay attention to those words. If a personal assistant, write use case stories (literal stories) with dialogs and events that occur.
