Something else that I'm noticing is that each experiment contains a ton of ideas that are hard to organize in a single text file. I need to be able to play with these ideas while being able to revisit them later.

I think a good approach for now is to approach it in a component-based way like when writing UI code.

For this reason, I'm creating a folder with unorganized notes for each experiment.

## Experiment Ideas

Think of the words needed to communicate with a [personal assistant, npc in a video game, etc] by manually simulating a real conversation. For example, if a video game, visualize the conversations and what you're doing and then pay attention to those words. If a personal assistant, write use case stories (literal stories) with dialogs and events that occur.
