%%`@QUICK NOTES`

It's important to remember that this problem is divided in 3 parts:

Part 1 - The initial truth model
Part 2 - The instancing mechanism - ego cells
Part 3 - the neighboring rules with genetic algorithms

Questions:

How much of a given buffer of text seems to be markdown? The answer reveals the amount of error or mismatch against the truth model.

--

I think this experiment really focuses on finding a common structure that allows knowledge about the world to be stored in a human oreadable way.

--

The more posibilities of identities the less activated it is. In other words, the less sure it is about who it is.

--

I'm getting too ahead of myself with this experiment. Even though it may be possible to determine a set of rules that allow to parse markdown, the result is unpractical. The building blocks are not the same I use in my mind. I can look at words and paragraphs. Before markdown there is regular text and that's a prerequisite that is becoming obvious.

--

Finding out that my mental model of markdown has flaws is a sign of how this mechanism actually works underneath. I still don't know how exactly though. Everybody has unaccurate or ineffective mental models.

I'm thinking about leaving this experiment as a failed one where I don't create a markdown parser. I think that I may benefit from finding a different problem to solve with the discoveries of this failed experiment.

I do feel though that I would benefit from a detailed explanation of why this experiment failed. Also show the ideas that were not tested like the word/separator approach where it's clear that we need a mechanism to represent encapsulation or scopes and recursiveness.

Also I think it's important to talk about being strict vs not, having the right requirements, and having unaccurate models.

Given I do quit this experiment, what would the next step be?
- Desiging the artificial world with the AKling approach and go from there.

## Introduciton

[[üìù Ego Cells]] are a type cellular automata that I intend to use as a mechanism to dynamically parse data as instances of complex systems.

Essentially, an ego cell's purpose is to identify itself as a part of a larger model or system to constantly update its identity based on its neighboring connections, although these connections are not necessarily always in a lattice.

So for example, an ego cell could represent a letter in a word or a word in a sentence. It could also represent a person in a group of people.


## Purpose

I started this experiment with the intentions of exploring this type of CA (cellular automata). I wanted to know how feasable it was to implement a small program that converts characters in a markdown file into multiple layers of ego cells that determines which syntactical component within markdown's syntax it represents. One could "ask" each character if they are part of a heading 3 or if they are part of the URL in a link, etc.


### How does this integrate into the big picture?

Essentially I need a flexible enough way to represent mental models that can be implemented cheaply on computers and paired with learning or genetic algorithms and other external computer programs. It seems to me that having a flexible tissue of cells that's able to determine how raw data relates to a model is a good start.

For example, letters can be linked to words and words to named experiences. At the same time named experiences can be linked to sensations to other people to names to producing hormones to contracting muscles and so on. Following this natural analogy, we want to be able to build cognitive organs and systems.

Thus, this first experiment aims to explore how a software implementation would look like that follows this train of thought with which a [[üìù Cognitive Architecture]] could be implemented.


## TL;DR

For as simple as markdown may seem it requires quite a few building blocks that I didn't take into account when I was initially thinking about this first experiment. Trying to find the neighboring rules needed to create this parser tissue lead me to discovering that there is an unkown number of possible building blocks that can be used to describe markdown ‚Äî it's not just characters in a grid and a high-level model.

What I found out is that the high-level model is made up of other models (or building blocks) that may have derived from different sources. For example, I initially didn't think I would need to represent words as characters separated by spaces and other special characters or that parsing requires a representation of sequence. Assuming these and other things was naive but it lead to a richer headspace for me now.

The next step would be to set the bar way lower and to focus on using the tools I developed in this experiment to try to solve easier problems than parsing markdown.


## Discoveries: Cell taxonomy and preconnected tissue

Ego cells can have subtypes that are connected differently in the tissue, there are also a few other helpful cells that are preconnected to them.

Defining the reach of the neighborhood or the number of abstraction layers above the raw data is determined by the problem requirements and nature.

In the case of parsing markdown, we could benefit from a larger neighborhood (6 cells of radius) and three layers of abstraction to represent the cell's identification with special characters (a `#`) tokens (the `###`'s) and blocks (a heading level 3).

Since I know the nature of parsing markdown, I can try to predict the needed reach in the tissue, not only that but also how they need to be preconnected ‚Äî I'll talk about preconnections after explaining a bit more about each cell type needed to parse markdown.

I have to say that I'm not doing Token Cells since that's the job of the genetic algorithm. So instead, I think that the size of the neighborhood and the other connections will always determine which tokens are possible and make more sense to solve the problem, in this case, parsing markdown.

### Character Cells (Ego Cell)

This is the obvious cell type. We need a way to represent characters in space. They are conencted 3 cells to their left and right and only 1 cell up and down. Each is also connected to the current, top and bottom Line Cells. For representing sequence, they are connected to the previous and next cells with a reach of 3 neighbors; if the next cell is in the line above or below, it will connect to it regardless.

%% `Insert Diagram Here` %%

`Connection Index`
```
N0..2 = Left Neighbors
N3..5 = Right Neighbors
TN = Top Neighbor
BN = Top Neighbor
PN = Previous Neighbor
NN = Next Neighbor
TL = Top Line
BL = Bottom Line
CL = Current Line
```

`Possible Self States`
```
These are the "hard truths we know" divided into 3 layers:

1. One of all characters categories or NULL (16 + 1)
2. One of all possible sub-blocks or NULL (10 + 1)
3. One of all possible blocks or NULL (9 +1)
```

Remember that a connection between cells mean they may have access to each state type if needed, so for example, between Character Cells they can read all 4 "layers" of state.


### Border Cells (Impostor Ego Cell)

These can pretend to be any type of Ego Cell and their value is always the same ‚Äî null. Real Ego Cells are connected to them when close to the border of the tissue thinking they are "living" neighbors.

%% `Insert Diagram Here` %%


### Line Cells (Ego Cell)

These are connected to a row of Character Cells in order to represent the "line" abstraction probably needed to parse markdown. These cells can determine their state based on what each Character Cell tells them and each Character cell can also read the state of the Line Cell.

%% `Insert Diagram Here` %%

`Connection Index`
```
C0..127 = Character Cells within the row
```

`Possible Self States`
```
1. One of all possible blocks or NULL
```


### Block Cells (Ego Cell)

These are anatomically similar to Line Cells. Each is connected to a Line Cell and each of their sibilings. Why? Because a single or multiple Line Cells could represent a Block. For example, a paragraph vs a heading.

%% `Insert Diagram Here` %%

`Connection Index`
```
L = Line Cell within the same row
TB0..126 = Every other Block Cell from top to bottom ???
```

`Possible Self States`
```
1. One of all possible blocks or NULL
```

At the time of writing this, I'm not sure if both Block Cells or Line Cells are needed since they do pretty much the same thing.


### More about preconnected lattices

Every cell is preconnected through a lattice. For example, neighboring connections between Charachter Cells represent the spatial interactions between the main actors. In the same way, cells need to be preconnected through in a way that we can represent a sense of sequence or time. Walls and/or corner cells would work similarly.

Since one of the limits I set for this experiment was to not use absolute coordinates as data available to cells, they instead have connections to cells representing important relative information about their position in space, time and any other dimension that would be needed.

We want to have preconnected tissue in order to be specific about the type of space or substrate that it's going to be sovling problems in.


## Problems

To get to the state of this publication, I had to try different ideas in paper and code, educate myself more on the topics of complexity and cellular automata.

%%`Memory and sequential patterns` 
Compared to spatial pattern recognition which is what the ego cells are currently doing, sequential pattern recognition presents itself as another essential building block.

Initially, I thought that some kind of memory was going to be needed to keep track of scopes (i.e. code block content vs paragraph content). Then, I thought maybe just spatial pattern recognition would be needed to identify scopes. But after realizing that links and inline-type blocks can wrap to new lines, nearest-neighboring rules can no longer solve the problem. This makes sense though. My original assumption about parsing markdown was that only top-down pattern recognition would be needed ‚Äî my own sequential reading of the text went unnoticed by myself.

This leaves me with either using a memory and/or using some kind of sequential pattern recognition cell type. I'm still not sure about how, but it's clear that since the nature of written language i.e. markdown is sequential, a cell for this would make sense to exist.

%%`Walls and limits ‚Äî Are these place cells?`
Initially, I was thinking that there shouldn't be a need to keep track of walls, but this turned out to be necessary. Raycasting means collision and a ray cannot go forever into a boundless canvas. At least mentally for me that's not the case when I look at a text file ‚Äî I know it has a start and an end. This is an important concept. I don't know if or how it translates into cells but there has to be a connection.
%%

%%`Spatial frameworks for modeling spatial systems`
While I was working on this experiment I was also reading papers such as "A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex" by Numenta (linked at bottom of this page). This paper proposes a framework for model-making that's based on the spatial properties and representations of objects in time. This research is based on humans and other animals which exist in and perceive this three-dimensional and physical world. I'm bringing this up because I couldn't help myself but come to hypothesize that for a 2D world made up of symbols in a grid, there has to be a similar approach that requires some analogous form of 2D grid cells, which takes me back to the previous paragraph where I mentioned a kind of coordinate system.

My new theory is that there has to be a similar framework for strictly two-dimensional grid-based spaces which requires the existance of multiple cell types or cell interactions. A universe's number of spatial dimensions and laws would determine how such a framework would be used.

In this experiment's case, there are a few ideas I have in regards to defining a spatial framework for representing information about systems within this bi-dimensional world of markdown.

%%`Underestimating the parsing problem`
What I came to realize is that my mental model of markdown has some weaknesses ‚Äî it's not as rigid as I thought. This complicated my process but at the same time it showed me how rigid models depend on hard non-overlapping rules.

In my mental model, there's a high-level representation of markdown syntax which consists of the output it generates: headings 1 to 6, paragraphs, links, etc. I know that a heading 1 starts with a hash for example.  But when it came to the feature-level of rules, I found myself improvising or rather discovering the neighboring rules as I set myself to do so.

What this means is that I came up with neighboring rules via trial-and-error only to figure out there could be a ton. I could argue that the high-level representation is based on my direct experience of the output or the actual rendering of the output HTML ‚Äî Everything is text, Headings are big and vary in size, links are blue and clickable, lists have indentation and bullet points, code has a colored background, etc.

I've been trying to map a visual representation (rendered HTML) into a symbolic representation with specific syntactical rules which I did not permit myself to be fully strict about (like a real parser would).

What I suspect is that we are always trying to figure out the low-level or "feature" details about our high-level models. Constantly re-evaluating them. This is where learning or genetic algorithms could play a role.

What I've also realized is that there's a million ways to solve the same problems. Using the specific cell types I developed and the neighboring rules I came up with are just one of many possible solutions. It's up to selection to find the most optimized one for the situation or world where it exists.

For example, I initially thought that some kind of memory would be needed to keep track of the heading level (1..6) considering that each cell can only access their direct neighbors. But then realized that it could also be solved by some kind of ray casting cell ‚Äî if the right most `#` cell can raycast to the left asking something about them than it can infer something about itself.
