So the way I see this is I'm building a tool that's a type of sim game as well. Your creations end up being useful to you by giving them access to your world - getting them "out" of the sandbox they're in, or rather a window to our world. As I've said before, this window is an API of sorts.

But World Building in particular, is the practice of designing, prototyping, testing and developing a world or environment with the goal of training an artificial mind to do specific actions that may benefit us or not by shaping their cognitive architecture using the environment as a mold.

In other words, the environment or world becomes the mold with which we shape the clay which is the instantiated artficial mind.

I'm using this analogy with clay because this process is a rather artistic or creative one. Experimentation and all there is to an art would apply.

This leads me to the point of how the actual software will look like â€” what my "end product" is.
