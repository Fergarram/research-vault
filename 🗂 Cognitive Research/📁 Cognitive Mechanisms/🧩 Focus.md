It's not the same as [[ðŸ§© Attention]]. Focusing is the act of fixating into a single point and orienting thoughts or contexts around it.

I imagine this to be like an area for activation. [[ðŸ§© Attention]] would be the agent that places focus into an area giving it "focus". When you focus onto some thought or thing in front of you, things around it blur as they appear away from the fixating point of focus.

Of course, there's gotta be more to this system.

This seems to be a performance or resource optimization of [[ðŸ§© Motivation]] and [[ðŸ§© Attention]].
