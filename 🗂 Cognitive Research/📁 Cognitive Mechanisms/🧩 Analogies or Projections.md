Sometimes when I make analogies myself, they serve as lenses through which I can even see new things, things that did not exist before in my mind or that were not as solid of ideas. I think that this happens all the time.

Toma un patron (1-dimension, 2, 3...) y projectalo/rotalo sobre otro eje. De esta manera podemos implementar [[ðŸ§© Analogies or Projections]] en una grid neuronal.

Every single idea or concept is projectable. Every word.
