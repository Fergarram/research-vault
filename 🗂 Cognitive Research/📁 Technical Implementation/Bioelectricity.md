Resting potential of cells regulates their behavior, but bioelectric control is not limited to individual cells.

‚ùóÔ∏è Key Finding: Highly active cells like cancer cells are depolarized, while mature cells are hyperpolarized.

‚ùì Important Point: Bioelectric control of cancer and development is not limited to single cells, but extends to large cell networks.

üí° Insight: Bioelectricity is a kind of cognitive glue that sets the computational boundary of the collective intelligence of cells.
