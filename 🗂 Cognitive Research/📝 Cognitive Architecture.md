It's basically how the [[üìù Cognitive Mechanisms]] interact with each other to produce a working artificial mind.

Here's an image on how the architecture might work based on Joscha Bach's presentation on Attention:

Being a software developer and designer, thinking in terms of architecture is second nature to me. Thus, it became obvious that this would be a crucial model to think about this question: What [[üìù Cognitive Architecture]] would be needed in order for a system to produce an experience of a world that overlaps with ours and is capable of being manually taught by us?

I try to answer that question by all means available to me ‚Äî introspection, drugs, meditation, trauma ‚Äî and by looking at the work of others such as [Joscha Bach](https://bach.ai/), [Numenta](https://numenta.com/), [Daniel Everett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Everett), [Eckhart Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle), and more.

There have been more resources that I've studied but since this research vault is relatively recent, I don't have references to all those sources.

Another tool I came up with was to look at specific words that point to direct aspects of our experience and world that are necessary for useful communication with humans: [[‚ùì Words for analysis]].
