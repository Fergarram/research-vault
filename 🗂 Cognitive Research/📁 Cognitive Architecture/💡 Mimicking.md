Mimicking is a very interesting mechanism that humans and other animals have. 

Essentially, we learn to use our meat suit by seeing what feels better. When we observe another person DO something, our brains try to emulate the other person.

I had caught myself just mimicking a japanse dude talking even though was I was replicating was cooking.
