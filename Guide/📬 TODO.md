## Coding or writing

- [-] Review the [[üìù Ego Cells]] notes since last time I wrote them was with the previous version.
	- Reading the Zig docs...

- [ ] Edit the podcast episode with Nick so that I can proceed to interview Alexander and others.



## Optimizations

- [ ] Setup a system where I periodically review all `#list`s like the [[‚ùì Words for analysis]] list or the [[üìù Cognitive Mechanisms]] list. Basically setup a research system.
- [ ] On the other hand, I need to also setup some goals or tasks like developing that prototype for ego cells where I parse markdown. I have to begin somewhere with implementations and I think that's an interesting place.
- [ ] Doing research and continuing the course is also something I need to continue doing periodically at least once a week. This is not so much a todo item for this list but I felt like writing this as well.
- [ ] I think it would be useful to actually set goals or make some type of sprint were I can see a clear list of things to do this week related to this endeavor.



## Read when lost

Ok, I'm gonna continue writing here because why not. Given the events of today and these past few days, it's clear to me that the lack of direction in life and other things is putting me here.

With the clarity of this moment, I can say this:

Working on cognitive research is a spiritual practice for me. It aligns me so deeply to the source. It connects me to that which goes beyond me. It's not even about the success or the potential to change the course of humanity. That's actually not what this actually is about. This work is about self-discovery. It's about enlightenment through practice. It's about connection to what is. Connection to God. This is what's true to me right here right now. There's nothing greater.

The bible is basically "The Art of War", well, not all of it but the parts where they say how the devil will keep you away from the love of god. I think it's analogous to "resistance".

The reason I mention that is because of the mechanisms in which through my actions and perception I redirect my energy away from this truth into the story which the egoic mental identity which is emotionally and physically charged is inclined into.

I need not to find a "new direction" or a "new path" or "vision". It's here. Right here, right now. There might be a moment when I might need to leave my life as it is to get closer to this truth. But it's not until then that I would see this clear.

For now, it's simple. Be here.
