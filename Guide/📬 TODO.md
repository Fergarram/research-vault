## Coding or writing

- [-] Finish the first ego cells experiment
- [ ] Edit the podcast episode with Nick so that I can proceed to interview Alexander and others.



## Optimizations

- [ ] Setup a system where I periodically review all `#list`s like the [[‚ùì Words for analysis]] list or the [[üìù Cognitive Mechanisms]] list. Basically setup a research system.
- [ ] On the other hand, I need to also setup some goals or tasks like developing that prototype for ego cells where I parse markdown. I have to begin somewhere with implementations and I think that's an interesting place.
- [ ] Doing research and continuing the course is also something I need to continue doing periodically at least once a week. This is not so much a todo item for this list but I felt like writing this as well.
- [ ] I think it would be useful to actually set goals or make some type of sprint were I can see a clear list of things to do this week related to this endeavor.
