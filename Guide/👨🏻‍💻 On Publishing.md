My goal is not to necessarily create tools to solve abstract theoretical complex problems. My goal is to create a way of creating artificial minds so that we can augment our use of personal computers. So my publications are not intended to propose truths or reproducible solutions to established problems.

My intention with them is to share instructions on how to build artificial minds. Any other relevant finding that may be worth putting into a formal scientific paper could also be published, but that's not my goal.
