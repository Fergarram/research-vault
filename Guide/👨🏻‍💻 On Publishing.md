At some point, I want to generate an actual website from this wiki that would serve as a type of documentation or set of guides and instructions about how to build AMIs. Thus, I will need a publishing strategy.

- Narrow publishing to ready/clean documents
	- Marking documents that should be ignored
- Separate topics within their given domains
	- Cognitive, Complexity, OSes
- A Git branching strategy that separates the major domains
- Finally have an excuse to use obscurity.wiki

Hopefully, writing an Obsidian based SSG will not be a pain.
