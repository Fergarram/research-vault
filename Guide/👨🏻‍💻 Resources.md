#list

In order to not fill my resources list with a bunch of shit, I need to have some rules as to how much content I can add before I use it.

For example, for webistes, papers and videos, I can't have more than 3 unseen and unnoted resources. I have to write notes and tags for each so that they are nicely archived.
