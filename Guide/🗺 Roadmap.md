I was listening to [this podcast episode with Joscha Bach](https://cybersecurityinside.com/episodes/camille-machine-consciousness/) and I realized this: I‚Äôm developing and designing emulating systems for cognitive architectures. I don‚Äôt know if this means they are by default not sentient but just seem to be and function like so. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter because answering those type of questions is not my goal. My goal is to get a mind running in my emulator and to give people tools to test their cognitive architecture designs ‚Äî whether inspired by humans or not.

I wanted to write a publication about this but I think this is more for me. If at some point I feel like I need to clarify this then I will.

So, what making emulators means is that I can focus on the important part ‚Äî getting things working.

This also means that I have a clearer approach as to what to implement and what to research. It‚Äôs no longer a broad ‚ÄúI want to make artificial minds‚Äù but a more specific ‚ÄúI want to build an emulator for a cognitive architecture‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to design a cognitive architecture for X problem‚Äù.

For me, it changes the way I see things from now on.

So, what are the next steps right now?

I know that I have a few side-projects going on:
* Nuestro Voto
* Video Games

But my main projects are two:
* My cognitive research
* and Amos (WM)

Amos looks like a way to get a following and it‚Äôs not a 10-20 year long project but more of a 2-5 year long one. I think it‚Äôs more likely that in 2 years I can get a working window manager that can get the attention of people and leverage that. 

I think the goal should be to find an audience that enjoys ME developing and doing things online. It could start with Amos and continue with everything else. Also, there is no need to just focus on Amos. I can focus on both projects, exercise my systems programming, gain followers and get shit done.

This sounds like a good plan but who knows if this is how it goes.

## Roadmap for Amos

1. MVP: Get an infinite canvas with JuiceboxWM
	* Play with that until it‚Äôs relatively useful and expected base interactions work:
		* Multi Selection
		* Moving
		* Handling focus
		* Some keyboard shortcuts
2. Once I feel like the MVP is good enough for sharing, share on unix porn.
	* Observe response
	* Start putting more content more frequently so that fans can start expecting it
	* Formalize it into a YouTube channel or streaming, etc.
3. At this point, I‚Äôm ready to start planning more and setting a more formal roadmap for this project. My estimate is that it will take about 1 year to get here which means it may actually be 2 or 3.

## Roadmap for Cognitive Research

1. Finish Obscure to publish my research
	* Just follow the README in the repo.
2. Markdown Experiment
	* I think there is a fundamental problem to my approach:
		* I‚Äôm mapping the problem incorrectly - maybe I should try to solve the problem as for what it is: a parsing problem.
		* ‚úÖ Or maybe I just need to change it to be word based and have very specific definitions of the elements needed to solve this problem like recursivity.
		* Answer the following:
			* What's the strict formal definition of MD? as a parser would do
			* What concepts are needed for that?
			* How does this compare to the ambiguous approach based on words and other ideas?
			* Which one is more flexible, useful, practical, resource heavy? How do they compare?
3. World Server/Client Protocol
	* I‚Äôm referring to what‚Äôs in [[üß† Brain dump for the first world prototype]].
	* I think that the process of trying to implement those ideas will be similar to that of ego cells ‚Äî it‚Äôs going to make me build a pipeline for building this which I‚Äôm expecting it to look like a server/client system.
	* Since I mention simple ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù I think that the concept of ego cells will also benefit from this work.
	* I see this becoming the sandbox in which I play with ideas about cognitive architectures. This is the place to implement them and test them.


## Summary

1. Focus on finishing Obscure MVP this week.
2. Get back to Markdown Experiment OR work on NV's home page.
3. Setup Linux Environment (OpenSUSE + GNOME)
4. Get JuiceboxWM running with Xephyr
5. Get back to Cognitive Research, etc.
