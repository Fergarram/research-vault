## Thinking outloud

I need to have a place where I can explain precisely what I want to create while using the best words for SEO and actually finding people who understand what I mean. To be able to do this, I need to read more on the existing works. Starting with the items mentioned in [[💡 Embodiement]].

I don't want to make AGI. I think that's the direction where GPT-X is going.

What I want is to create a set of tools that allow us to create digital beings that collaborate with us. While the intelligence of these beings may seem like what we normally mean when we say AGI, a digital being is not a program that you can execute from a command line or query with an API. It's a real-time emulation of a cognitive architecture connected to a simulation of a digital world.


## Simulation & Emulation Tools

I was listening to [this podcast episode with Joscha Bach](https://cybersecurityinside.com/episodes/camille-machine-consciousness/) and I realized this: I’m developing and designing emulating systems for cognitive architectures. I don’t know if this means they are by default not sentient but just seem to be and function like so. But it doesn’t really matter because answering those type of questions is not my goal. My goal is to get a mind running in my emulator and to give people tools to test their cognitive architecture designs — whether inspired by humans or not.

I wanted to write a publication about this but I think this is more for me. If at some point I feel like I need to clarify this then I will.

So, what making emulators means is that I can focus on the important part — getting things working.

This also means that I have a clearer approach as to what to implement and what to research. It’s no longer a broad “I want to make artificial minds” but a more specific “I want to build an emulator for a cognitive architecture” and “I want to design a cognitive architecture for X problem”.

For me, it changes the way I see things from now on.

So, what are the next steps right now?

I know that I have a few side-projects going on:
* Nuestro Voto
* Video Games

But my main projects are two:
* My cognitive research
* and Amos (WM)

Amos looks like a way to get a following and it’s not a 10-20 year long project but more of a 2-5 year long one. I think it’s more likely that in 2 years I can get a working window manager that can get the attention of people and leverage that. 

I think the goal should be to find an audience that enjoys ME developing and doing things online. It could start with Amos and continue with everything else. Also, there is no need to just focus on Amos. I can focus on both projects, exercise my systems programming, gain followers and get shit done.

This sounds like a good plan but who knows if this is how it goes.

## Roadmap for Amos

1. MVP: Get an infinite canvas with JuiceboxWM
	* Play with that until it’s relatively useful and expected base interactions work:
		* Multi Selection
		* Moving
		* Handling focus
		* Some keyboard shortcuts
2. Once I feel like the MVP is good enough for sharing, share on unix porn.
	* Observe response
	* Start putting more content more frequently so that fans can start expecting it
	* Formalize it into a YouTube channel or streaming, etc.
3. At this point, I’m ready to start planning more and setting a more formal roadmap for this project. My estimate is that it will take about 1 year to get here which means it may actually be 2 or 3.

## Roadmap for Cognitive Research

1. ~~Finish Obscure to publish my research~~
	* ~~Just follow the README in the repo.~~
2. Markdown Experiment
3. World Server/Client Protocol
	* I’m referring to what’s in [[🧠 Brain dump for the first world prototype]].
	* I think that the process of trying to implement those ideas will be similar to that of ego cells — it’s going to make me build a pipeline for building this which I’m expecting it to look like a server/client system.
	* Since I mention simple “creatures” I think that the concept of ego cells will also benefit from this work.
	* I see this becoming the sandbox in which I play with ideas about cognitive architectures. This is the place to implement them and test them.


## Summary

1. ~~Focus on finishing Obscure MVP this week.~~
2. Get back to Markdown Experiment ~~OR work on NV's home page.~~
3. Setup Linux Environment (OpenSUSE + GNOME)
4. Get JuiceboxWM running with Xephyr
5. Get back to Cognitive Research, etc.
