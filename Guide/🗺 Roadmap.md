## Thinking outloud

I need to have a place where I can explain precisely what I want to create while using the best words for SEO and actually finding people who understand what I mean. To be able to do this, I need to read more on the existing works. Starting with the items mentioned in [[üí° Embodiement]].

I don't want to make AGI. I think that's the direction where GPT-X is going.

What I want is to create a set of tools that allow us to create digital beings that collaborate with us. While the intelligence of these beings may seem like what we normally mean when we say AGI, a digital being is not a program that you can execute from a command line or query with an API. It's a real-time emulation of a cognitive architecture connected to a simulation of a digital world.


## Simulation & Emulation Tools

I was listening to [this podcast episode with Joscha Bach](https://cybersecurityinside.com/episodes/camille-machine-consciousness/) and I realized this: I‚Äôm developing and designing emulating systems for cognitive architectures. I don‚Äôt know if this means they are by default not sentient but just seem to be and function like so. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter because answering those type of questions is not my goal. My goal is to get a mind running in my emulator and to give people tools to test their cognitive architecture designs ‚Äî whether inspired by humans or not.

I wanted to write a publication about this but I think this is more for me. If at some point I feel like I need to clarify this then I will.

So, what making emulators means is that I can focus on the important part ‚Äî getting things working.

This also means that I have a clearer approach as to what to implement and what to research. It‚Äôs no longer a broad ‚ÄúI want to make artificial minds‚Äù but a more specific ‚ÄúI want to build an emulator for a cognitive architecture‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to design a cognitive architecture for X problem‚Äù.

For me, it changes the way I see things from now on.

## Long-term vision (5-10 years)

* Alpha versions of world simulation tools
* Alpha versions of cognitive architecture tools
* CogArch, Mind Studio

## Mid-term vision (2-5 years)

* Video game based on my engines
* Solid primitives for my engines
* Gain true fans / Auto-sustainable project

## Short-term vision (1-2 years)

* Start recording progress and create devlogs or offline-streams
* Simple world simulations (brain dump doc)
* Connect world to brains (server to CogArch emulator) and perform experiments
* Create experiments per word in ‚Äúwords for analyzing‚Äù
* Focus on use cases and the words that emerge from those fake conversations. It‚Äôs those words that will gain priority when creating experiments to test those concepts.

## Immediate goals or milestones

* Synthesize all major ideas
* Figure out the right keywords
* Create a user journey of your work so people can navigate it
* Improve Obscure so that it covers most features
* Have monthly/etc calls with Nick to review my work or some other similar social tool like this
* Finish [[üî¨ Experiment 001a - Parsing Markdown with Cellular Automata]].

## How can I make a living?

I like the **true fans** option better. I see that as a more tangible one that gets a better result in the end. It‚Äôs also a patience play.

The only problem is time, but that‚Äôs actually not a big big problem.

### How can I add value to others?

Selling pre-trained brains for video games seems like the best first use-case for actually making money.
	* based on genre
	* language
	* etc

Selling pre-trained brains for tools is the longer-term option.
	* Amos / WonderOS

I don‚Äôt really want to build software tools in order to make money (IDEs, text editors, etc). I would love to already have them within the environment I like.

I would like to work on them, but not for money. Maybe just customize them (?)  What I mean is I don‚Äôt want to code those tools in a traditional sense ‚Äî it would have to be with the new itemized paradigm.

Having said this, I think I would prefer to make money by selling the trained brains. This is a long-long term goal. I would first need to make a living just by supporters and not by selling a product or service.

### Amos is secondary

I really want to commit to the development of digital cognition tools. My OS research and tool development is secondary, but it will eventually merge with my digital cognition tools. This is why I think it‚Äôs important that I focus on my cognitive research first ‚Äî this is where I have an edge, where I shine.
